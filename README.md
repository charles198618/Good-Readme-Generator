# Good-Readme-Generator


## Description 

This is a README generator that I'm creating. Basically, by typing node.js on the terminal, I have the ability to answer to the question that comes up one after another. Thus, it allows a full-stack web developper to show off what he is able to do. Thus, it is a file that must be well organized.

## OBJECTIVES

The motivation that pushed me to realize this project is because I wanted to solve a problem in the tech world. I wanted the developper to be able to showcase their skills. Mostly the employer wants to look at the README of a candidate to make sure he is a good developper. Therefore this project will help new candidate to have a strong README that will help them to learn a dream job in the tech industry.


## Languages used

In order to get to this result, I have use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.JS. First of all, we can think about HTML as a body. it stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Basically, it is a language that we can use to create web pages. Thus every single on internet is written using HTML. Moreover, it includes elements on the pages, images on the pages, the orders of the appearance of elements and so on. Secondly, we have CSS that stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used to make our website beautiful. It's used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, the thickness, and color of a table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. The third most important element to point out is JavaScript. It is a pragramming language like Java, PHP, Python, C++. It's considered as the brain in human body. It allows us to implement complex features on web pages, animated graphics, interactive maps and so on.  It's with JavaScript that we have succeded to make this project work.

Node.JS is an open source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment designed to be run outside of the browser.
It is a general utility that can be used for a variety of purposes including asset compilation, scripting, monitoring, and most notably as the basis for web servers.



## Challenges met

There was many challenges during the realization of this project. The big obstacle was how to run node on the terminal, to make README.
